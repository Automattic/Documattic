<h3>What is WordPress?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">WordPress is an open source content management system (CMS) which began in 2003 as a blogging platform but soon branched out into a platform for different types of websites, including news sites, corporate and government sites, ecommerce sites, and many more.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Today, WordPress powers roughly 22% of the top 10 million websites on the planet, making it the most widely-used CMS in the world. The next largest CMS is Joomla, with ~3% of the top 10 million sites, and followed by Drupal at ~2%.</p>

<h3>How is WordPress being used in government?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">WordPress is used heavily at all levels of government, and there has been a recent surge in adoption and growth as government agencies seek out lower-cost, scalable open source solutions to power their websites, intranets, and blogs. Technologists at all level of government are now assessing WordPress as a replacement for legacy CMS’s and we expect to see a continued acceleration of WordPress’s growth in the coming years in government as well as other sectors where it’s currently growing. WordPress has a federal–compatible Terms of Service agreement, which makes purchasing services from WordPress.com and WordPress.com VIP fast and easy.

<h3>Who uses WordPress in government?</h3>
There are dozens of government agencies who have adopted the use of WordPress to power their CMS, as well as their blogs and sub-agency sites. WordPress is also heavily used for internal communications and collaboration. Following the release of President Obama’s <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government.html">Digital Government Strategy</a>, agencies are seeking out affordable, scalable, and extensible open source software solutions that are heavily documented and supported by a robust community of developers, designers, and engineers.
<p dir="ltr">Some notable examples of government agencies currently using WordPress include the <a href="https://max.gov/unclesamslist/">White House</a>, <a href="http://www.data.gov/">Data.gov</a>, <a href="http://cfpb.gov/">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a>, <a href="http://blogs.justice.gov/main/">Department of Justice</a>, <a href="http://data.nasa.gov/">NASA</a>, <a href="http://blog.epa.gov/blog/">Environmental Protection Agency</a>, <a href="http://blogs.loc.gov/">Library of Congress</a>, <a href="http://directorsblog.nih.gov/">National Institutes of Health</a>, <a href="http://armylive.dodlive.mil/">United States Army</a> and the <a href="http://blog.usaid.gov/">USAID</a>.

<h3>Why would a government agency use WordPress over other CMS / custom-built solutions?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">One of the great advantages of WordPress is that you get a ready-to-use CMS right out of the box. Should your project require a more complex approach, you can easily build out custom solutions by integrating plugins with the core WordPress software. Good examples of companies using WordPress as a full content management system are the New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, Time.com and CBS Local.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the most recent 2012 WordPress user survey, we found that 92% of all users were utilizing WordPress as a full CMS and not just as a blogging tool. WordPress is the content management system (CMS) of the web – 18% of the top 10 million sites are powered by WordPress and WordPress sites attract more than 663 million unique visitors each month. With a good team and a knowledgeable developer, you can make WordPress work for projects of any size - with simple, as well as complex development requirements and with varying traffic demands.</p>

<h3>How secure is WordPress?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">WordPress is very secure and powers some of the largest, most highly-trafficked websites on earth, including WordPress.com, which is one of the top 25 most trafficked websites in the world, and the #1 network of websites in the United States. Like any software, vulnerabilities and security issues can be encountered if developers are not following up-to-date best practices or if the server setup, whether internal or managed by a third-party, isn’t optimized for WordPress use. However, if you’re running a fully optimized WordPress install, your site will be running software that is safe, secure, and scalable.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Refer to the <a href="http://vip.wordpress.com/security">Security FAQ</a> on WordPress.com VIP site for more information on how we approach security as the WordPress.com VIP team, and also some insight on how the core software team handles security issues.
