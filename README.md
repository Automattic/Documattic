<h3>What is this?</h3>

This is the source of several documents which can be used by the WordPress community to create, modify, enhance, or distribute information about WordPress. Documents will largely focus on technical specifications, capabilities, features, and other information with a marketing, project and/or informational aim. We'd like some of the work the WordPress.com VIP team has been doing educating users and clients to become available and useful to the rest of the WordPress community.
