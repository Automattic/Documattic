Teacher's Reference and Readme for Superuser Training Materials
==============

Course Description
---------------
In this course, the participant will learn how to manage and use the WordPress interface from a site owner’s point of view; as someone who will be managing multiple users, their permissions, and ultimately sharing knowledge with them about how to use WordPress to publish a great site with an active community and/or audience. We like to think of this course as teaching your teachers – those who will serve as the WordPress experts in an organization.

The course also does a deep dive into the publishing process so superusers can teach their editors, authors, and contributors how to best use the WordPress interface. From creating and publishing posts to managing tags and categories, from mastering multimedia and images in articles, and bulk management of posts and pages, we’ll cover the entire publishing process from draft to done.

Student Prerequisites
---------------
Users should have a working (beyond basic) knowledge of the WordPress administration panel / backend. They should be managers, administrators, site owners, or editors of an existing or future WordPress site with multiple users.


Instructors: How to use these materials
--------------

While the majority of the training material applies to both WordPress.com and self-hosted WordPress sites, some of the special features which are standard for free WordPress.com accounts are also available to self-hosted WordPress sites through the Jetpack plugin, which can be downloaded at http://jetpack.me.
